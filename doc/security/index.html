<p>This page collects security matters that developers should be aware of when
creating applications with Aspen. If you have security bugs to disclose, you
can use the email and PGP key <a href="/security.txt">listed here</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest thing to be aware of when deploying Aspen applications is to be
careful of what ends up in your web publishing root. If an attacker is able to
write files into your web publishing root, then the attacker can execute
arbitrary Python code with the permissions of the user that the Aspen process
is running as.</p>

<p>In particular, watch out for:</p>

<ul>
    <li>File uploads. Never write user-uploaded files 
<p></p>
